# Outputs

This folder stores training checkpoints and simulation results.

Typical structure:
- `outputs/checkpoints/` model weights (`.pt`) and exported phase masks (`.npz`)
- `outputs/simulations/` intensity maps, predictions, and fields (`.npz`, `.png`, `.csv`)

Large binaries are ignored by git; only this README is tracked.
