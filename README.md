# DNN-for-intelligent-breast-tumor-detection-or-skin-tumor-detection
> This topic pertains to the design of a metasurface-based diffractive neural network (DNN) forintelligent breast tumor detection or skin tumor detection. This topic also involves deep learningand related Python programming. The schematic of a DNN is shown below. It can performcomputation based on the physical propagation of electromagnetic waves through several layersof metasurface. Many works have applied DNNs on number classification and fashion productclassification. Phase of each meta-atom of the metasurfaces can be tuned from 0 to 2π.You need to design the meta-atom distributions in each layer of metasurface to realize thedetection of a breast tumor. Detailed meta-atom structure is provided to you. Three layers ofmetasurface are needed. Only simulation results are needed for this topic.
